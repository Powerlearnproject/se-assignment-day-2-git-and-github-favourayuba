## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is like a save button for your code. It keeps track of changes you make, so you can go back to earlier versions if needed. This is really helpful when working with teams or when you want to fix mistakes without losing your work.
GitHub is a popular tool for version control because it allows people to store their code online, share it, and collaborate easily. You can see what changes were made, who made them, and discuss improvements with others.
Version control helps maintain project integrity by:
1. **Tracking Changes**: You can see the history of changes, making it easy to understand how the project evolved.
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
3. **Restoring Previous Versions**: If something goes wrong, you can quickly go back to a stable version of the code.
4. **Branching**: You can create separate copies of the project to try new ideas without affecting the main project.
Overall, it keeps projects organized and reduces the risk of mistakes.
